The tax (and Roth conversion) information in this tool is non-existent in the Fidelity tool ( my guess is on purpose) but their income and expense details are so much more comprehensive allowing you to add or change particular items and amounts on a year by year basis. Looks like I&#39;ll be using both tools now until I find the &#39;one tool to rule them all&#39; (haha, sorry about the poor dad joke).

I love how this channel has really opened my eyes on the fact that I can continue to learn things even without certificates or degrees and still be successful. Sometimes I feel like it&#39;s cheating, but in life it is actually okay to say you know something when you have taught yourself. Too many of us struggle with imposter syndrome which is truly sad and many wonderful people out there can&#39;t do what they truly want simply because they think they are not good enough.",

Mutual Aid donations are awesome and so are investments directly to those who may need a boost to mental health as well. (I think something that is clear to me again (even in this video) is that many wealthy people don&#39;t make allowances for &quot;spontaneous&quot; &quot;generosity of needed&quot; (made clear by the dinner out with friends things with all the calculations) (Not going to lie. I would be relieved in some ways as NO WAY could I split a bill evenly with wealthy people if they went to an expensive restaurant and it was really thoughtful in that way to make sure that was a way they could be inclusive) but sometimes if there is too much emphasis on &quot;row your own boat&quot; as this mentality that &quot;wealthy people are wealthy because they hoard wealth and poor people are poor because they are too generous&quot; then being a person who understand community efforts and community care somehow becomes a &quot;poor person thing&quot; instead of an everyone thing like it should be. I&#39;m so glad at least one person at that seminar said something about donations. That&#39;s a GOAT for sure.",
